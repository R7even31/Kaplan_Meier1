The Kaplan-Meier estimator can be applied across various fields for numerous purposes. In the medical field, it is often used to measure the fraction of patients surviving for a certain period after treatment, helping assess the effectiveness of a particular treatment. Beyond medicine, Kaplan-Meier can be utilized to measure the duration people remain unemployed after losing a job, or the time until failure of machine parts.
In insurance, it is valuable for calculating risks and premiums based on life expectancy. Additionally, in sales, it can help evaluate how long customers stay subscribed to a service. Thus, the Kaplan-Meier estimator is a versatile tool that can be applied in almost any field to assess risks over time or the effectiveness of a treatment or product.1
